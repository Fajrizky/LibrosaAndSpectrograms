# LibrosaAndSpectrograms
My notebook for this companion video: https://youtu.be/hJxmJfhLHbE

The goal of this notebook is to find:

* Smallest resolution spectrogram without losing clear patterns
* Convert spectrograms created from wavs of differing audio length into uniform shape
* Generally improve knowledge of librosa
